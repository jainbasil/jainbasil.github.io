Hi, I’m **Jain Basil Aliyas**, a software developer at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) based in Bengaluru, India. I spend my days building software, but my curiousity extends far beyond code. Outside of work, I’m passionate about playing the piano, reading, and photography. 

This blog is my space to explore ideas that fascinate me — technology, travel, and the everyday observations that shape how we see the world. I write primarily in English, but occasionally switch to Malayalam to bring in a different cultural lens and connect with my roots.

You may contact me through [email](mailto:jainbasil@gmail.com) and [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jainbasil).
