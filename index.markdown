Hi, I'm **Jain Basil Aliyas**, a software developer at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) based in Bengaluru, India. I spend my days building software, but my curiousity extends far beyond code. Outside of work, I'm passionate about playing the [piano](/archives/tag/piano), [reading](/archives/tag/books), and [photography](/archives/tag/photography).  
<br />

This blog is my space to explore ideas that fascinate me — technology, [travel](/archives/tag/travel), and the everyday observations that shape how we see the world. I write primarily in English, but occasionally switch to [Malayalam](/archives/tag/malayalam) to bring in a different cultural lens and connect with my roots.
