2025 came and went at lightning speed. Looking back, I realized my resolutions were either misaligned with my goals or simply left unachieved. It left me asking: *What did I really do this year?*

I spent the year in decision paralysis. Between the stress of endless choices and the existential fear of AI taking over jobs, I ended up stressed, unfocused, and exhausted. Content consumption and the information overload also contributed their parts. It taught me that outcome-based goals are often a trap. Reading 25 random books just to say I did it doesn't help me. Goals need purpose. If I'm not reading to learn something specific or improve my career and personal/family life, the number doesn't matter.

So, for 2026, I have ‘Projects’ instead of resolutions. Projects are designed to run for more than a year and focus on adding quality to life over the years, rather than just hitting a target.

My piano practice is a perfect example. While I did my ABRSM grade in 2025, I view it as a continuous, multi-year project of learning, not a one-off goal. I’m also treating **Minimalism** as a project. To beat the analysis paralysis I felt last year, I’m actively removing choices. I’m paring down my collection of fountain pens, headphones, notebooks, computers etc. to just the essentials. By getting rid of the excess, I’m making room for clarity.
